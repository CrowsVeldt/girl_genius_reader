Girl Genius and all associated characters, names, events, concepts, orginizations, bloodlines, slang, and antics, are the property of Studio Foglio, LLC, as far as I'm concerned. 

I absolutely adore Girl Genius, and have reread it many times. Unfortunately the website is, shall we say, unoptimized for touch screen interactions and small screens.
One day I thought to myself that I really wished someone would make a mobile app for GG, and then later on I thought why shouldn't *I* make one.
