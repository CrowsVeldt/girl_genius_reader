Update: I finally managed to get in touch with the artists, but unfortunately didn't get their permission to publish it. So I'm going to stop working on this. It was fun while it lasted.


I absolutely adore Girl Genius, and have reread it many times. Unfortunately the website is, shall we say, unoptimized for touch screen interactions and small screens.One day I thought to myself that I really wished someone would make a mobile app for GG, and then later on I thought why shouldn't *I* make one.
