Fixes/improvements:
? fix app crashing on add bookmark
- remove necessity for undefined/null check in lastElement function
- fix non-serializeable values error, i.e. nav passing as prop

Features, planned:
- steampunk aesthetic, inspired by GG website
- add drawer menu, move links to bookmarks, etc. to there
- add menuOpen state to homescreen/app
! Swipe or tap on side of screen to move forward or back
- display toast/message to inform user when updating, finished updating, network error, etc.

Features, possible
? Store comics by volume/year?

Notes: 
- Final comic doesn't have 'topnext' link

Done:
x Make update loop stop even if it returns undefined
x replace scrollview with flatlist in listscreen
x redo storage structure: add key for dates, key for bookmarks
x Image behaviour: 
x - on release pinch, stay at current zoom level. 
x - on double-tap, if image is at normal size, go to maximum zoom centered on tap point
x - on double-tap, if image is zoomed, zoom out to full size
x Save dates as a file kept in the repository, so it doesn't have to fetch from the beginning
x add current date to stored values
x in dev mode, on app restart, it returns to the comic before the last one viewed
