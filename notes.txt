Fixes/improvements:
- rework date orginization/storage: use page:pageType rather than date:string to save the current page?
- better display/organize volume lists
- optimize animations and transitions for speed
- if comic is zoomed out than swipe from anywhere in the screen will change page

- Date exceptions:
- - 20030106>20030106b (20030106 points to the wrong comic)
- - 20141226a-20141226b (a is the comic, b is a wallpaper)

Done:
x Make update loop stop even if it returns undefined
x replace scrollview with flatlist in listscreen
x redo storage structure: add key for dates, key for bookmarks
x Image behaviour: 
x - on release pinch, stay at current zoom level. 
x - on double-tap, if image is at normal size, go to maximum zoom centered on tap point
x - on double-tap, if image is zoomed, zoom out to full size
x Save dates as a file kept in the repository, so it doesn't have to fetch from the beginning
x add current date to stored values
x in dev mode, on app restart, it returns to the comic before the last one viewed
x fix app crashing on add bookmark
x Final comic doesn't have 'topnext' link
x fix non-serializeable values error, i.e. nav passing as prop
x add drawer menu button to title bar, display over screen (not sure how)
x Comic list: 
x - List comics in a collapsing tree/table
x - (act) > volume > page/date  
x - have page titles displayed next to the page/date
x make whole list screen scrollable
x in list add 'page %' in addition to the date
x use Pressable component to allow pressing side of screen to change page
x prevent scrolling when image is zoomed out
x on restart, date is first set to 20021104, before date is loaded from memory, but date in comicnav is already set
x Swipe or tap on side of screen to move forward or back
x Volume 9 is rolled into volume 10, need to check them all
x make panswipe indicator an arrow centered in the screen
X List screen not scrolling
x allow for closing VolumeLists, perhaps by double-tapping
x removing bookmark from bookmarks page doesn't reset star button on home page (?)
x add bookmark button to header?
X have star button fade after a period of inactivity
x replace DateContext with ComicContext
x show star button *only* on homescreen
X show scene title on homescreen?
x add vol# & page# to header
