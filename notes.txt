Fixes/improvements:
- on restart, date is first set to 20021104, before date is loaded from memory, but date in comicnav is already set
- prevent scrolling when image is zoomed out
- use Pressable component to all pressing side of screen to change page

Features, planned:
- steampunk aesthetic, inspired by GG website
- Swipe or tap on side of screen to move forward or back
- option to display two pages side-by-side in landscape mode

Features, minor
- add drawer menu, move links to bookmarks, etc. to there
- display toast/message to inform user when updating, finished updating, network error, etc.

Features, possible
? Store comics by volume/year?

Done:
x Make update loop stop even if it returns undefined
x replace scrollview with flatlist in listscreen
x redo storage structure: add key for dates, key for bookmarks
x Image behaviour: 
x - on release pinch, stay at current zoom level. 
x - on double-tap, if image is at normal size, go to maximum zoom centered on tap point
x - on double-tap, if image is zoomed, zoom out to full size
x Save dates as a file kept in the repository, so it doesn't have to fetch from the beginning
x add current date to stored values
x in dev mode, on app restart, it returns to the comic before the last one viewed
x fix app crashing on add bookmark
x Final comic doesn't have 'topnext' link
x fix non-serializeable values error, i.e. nav passing as prop
