TODO: 
- FIX: page numbers, allow for exceptions. finished volumes 1-10
- PRIORITY: Fix zoom behaviour: Zoom should have animation, zoom should work reliably after page change
- FIX: check message box for unsafe/bad input: Escape code, ignore trailing whitespace, etc.
- FIX: changelog popup not appearing
- FIX: final volume number hardcoded in VolumeScreen.tsx
- FIX: back button behaviour: changing page or volume screen should be pushed to the nav history
- improve/fix test suite
- Improve color contrast (re: android pre-publishing report)
- Add accessibilityLabels to components
- Add more informative errors with error codes, etc.
- Add details for bug reports to message form, i.e.: type of bug

BUG: if user double-taps immediately after changing comic page then panning will usually not work until user zooms out again
- Add animation to opening and closing volumeSubMenu

Ideas:
- make it so the user doesn't have to uninstall/reinstall to get an updated datelist
- have changelog entries collapsed by default, click to open
- make changelog a scroll list
- add a temporary currentPage constant to comicContext, to allow for jumping to different pages and then returning easily
- Have first and last comic navigation buttons not update the main current comic page?
- trigger popup when send button is pressed on messagescreen, asking the user if they are really ready to send the message
- add a "GoToPage" option to go to a specific page by number
- add notice on main page if GG site is down
- Automatically have volume scroll horizontally when in landscape mode?
- Implement two-page view for landscape mode, like reading the actual books
- when user is scrolling the volume view, have the screen slide to showing the one full image 
  when the user lifts their finger
- implement light/dark mode support

- Add message dev link to homescreen?
- Add volume list to homescreen?
- in network functions, handle dates with letter suffixes?
- replace store link on home screen with a dropdown with links to each individual site?
- pan shouldn't count towards double-tap?
- make sure bookmark list works well with many bookmarks
- replace NetStatus component with toast?
- set comic loading indicator with loadingIndicatorSource property?
- Refactor/Simplify collectPageAndVollumeLists()

Notes: Message form composeAsync always returns "sent" on Android due to platform limitations
